## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Images Not Displaying?

If images are not showing up:

1. **Check URLs**: Ensure image URLs in `_config.yml` are complete and accessible
2. **Test URLs**: Open image URLs directly in browser to verify they work
3. **Use HTTPS**: Prefer HTTPS URLs for better security and compatibility
4. **Check file formats**: Use common formats like PNG, JPG, or WEBP

### Common Issues

- **404 errors**: Verify image URLs are correct and accessible
- **Mixed content**: Use HTTPS URLs when your site is served over HTTPS
- **Slow loading**: Optimize image sizes (recommended max: 4MB per image)
- **CORS issues**: Host images on a CDN or your own domain

### üí° Tips

- **Use CDN**: Services like Cloudinary, Imgur, or your own CDN for better performance
- **Optimize images**: Compress images before uploading
- **Test locally**: Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to test before deploying
